\usage{
expandComponentGrid(componentSetting)
}
\arguments{
\item{componentSetting}{The user's setting for the component. This can be:
- A single string (e.g., "AdamW").
- A single named list representing one configuration (e.g., `list(name = "AdamW", lr = 0.001)`).
- A list of named lists, where each list is a template for configurations.
  Vectors within these templates will be expanded (e.g., `lr = c(0.001, 0.0001)`).}
}
\value{
A list where each element is a fully-specified, named list for one
        component configuration.
}
\description{
This function takes a user-defined setting for a configurable component
(like a positional encoding) and expands it
into a flat list of all possible configurations. This list can then be
used directly within a `paramGrid` for `PatientLevelPrediction::listCartesian`.
}
